  Alongside my interests in economic research, some of my other interests are,
  
   - Classical Music: I have practiced violin playing for 16 years and used to be the chair violin of Tsinghua University Symphony Orchestra. I really enjoy playing chamber music with my friends. Check our performance here! 
     - 2017 TUSO Chamber Music Concert, with Miaoyan Zhang, Yingran Zhang and Jiasheng Zhang, [Primavera Portena by Astor Piazzolla](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ux411v7W7?p=13)
